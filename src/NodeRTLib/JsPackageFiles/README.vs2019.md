## Notice

The series of `@nodert-win10-20h1` packages is unofficially-published NodeRT modules for **Windows 10 SDK, version 2004 (10.0.19041.0)** corresponding to Windows 10 Version 2004 (Codename 20H1 / May 2020 Update).

These are generated by the modified version of NodeRT thus are experimental, as the original doesn't have support for 20H1 SDK, nor for building with VS2019. Supporting for VS2019 is based on <a href="https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT/pull/136" target="_blank">Taosenai's workaround with lxbndr's suggestion</a>. The modified source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/MaySoMusician/NodeRT/tree/feature/136-vs2019" target="_blank">here</a>.

Below is the original description about this module.

---

A Node.js wrapper for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/{Namespace}.aspx" target="_blank">{Namespace}</a> WinRT namespace, compatible with Windows {WinVersion} APIs.

Using this module, you'll be able to consume the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/{Namespace}.aspx" target="_blank">{Namespace}</a> API directly from Node.js.

This module was automatically generated by <a href="https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT" target="_blank">NodeRT</a>. 
For more information on NodeRT and examples on how to use NodeRT modules, please visit the project page at: <a href="https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT" target="_blank">https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT</a>.

The API exposed by this module is (almost) the same as the API that is listed in: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/{Namespace}.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/{Namespace}.aspx</a>

The only difference in the API is in the way that asynchronous methods and events are used. (See <a href="https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT#ConsumingNodeRT" target="_blank">https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT#ConsumingNodeRT</a> for more details)

This module also contains TypeScript definition files for the API exposed by the module, as well as JavaScript intellisense support for <a href="http://nodejstools.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Node.js tools for Visual Studio</a>.

Prequisites:
============
* Visual Studio 2019 and above. (Community edition works, other editions aren't tested but surely work!)
* Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 (for node-gyp)
* <b>Important:</b> Updated versions of npm and node-gyp. (Note that the ones that are bundled with node might not be up to date). In order to install latest npm, run:
```
npm install -g npm
```

In order to install latest node-gyp run:
```
npm install -g node-gyp
```

If you wish to rebuild this module using node-gyp, make sure to use the appropriate VS version using --msvs_version=2012/2013/2015/2017/2019 flag:

For example:

```
cd [module folder path]
node-gyp rebuild --msvs_version=2019
```

If you fail to rebuild due to unable to find module 'nan', try running `npm install --ignore-scripts`
